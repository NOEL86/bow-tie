              Hello my dear! My name is Cortney Kuntz and I am Founder and Lead
              Planner of Bow & Tie Events. I love traveling, being a dog mom,
              murder mystery shows, trying new foods and laundry as odd as it
              sounds.{" "}

              I have always been a planner by nature and now as a professional!
              I remember planning all my birthday parties as a kid almost a year
              in advance. I loved coming up with various themes, color palettes,
              and activities in my Lisa Frank notebook.

              I am a 911 dispatcher which shares similar qualities with being an
              event planner. I’m used to working with all different types of
              people including difficult people, strange, long hours without
              breaks all in high stress situations where decisions need to be
              made quickly.{" "}

              I’ve always considered being an event planner, but just never
              pulled the trigger. After getting engaged in May of 2018 and
              planning my own wedding, I enjoyed it so much that I knew after
              ours was complete, I needed to give it a shot. So, here we are!
              I’m so excited to meet you and can’t wait to get started on making
              your vision a reality.{" "}

              I’m Anna Heffernan, Designer for Bow & Tie Events. I love the
              great outdoors, am a puzzle fanatic, and have a book collection
              that my bookshelf collection struggles to keep up with. Having
              recently moved to the Pacific Northwest from New England, I find
              myself utterly inspired by the natural beauty and rich culture of
              my new home.
            </p>{" "}
            <p>
              I was born with a passion for creating beautiful things, and when
              I began to work in the event industry I found that it translated
              perfectly into the execution of a vision for an event. I have
              since been working to deliver the visions of many clients over the
              last decade. I believe that careful listening and clear
              communication are the most important qualities when trying to
              create a complete vision of a beautiful wedding.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am so excited to be working with Cortney and Bow & Tie Events,
              and I can’t wait to see what we can do for you and your special
              day.
